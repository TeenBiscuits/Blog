As you may have guessed, my name is Pablo, <ins class="decoration-wavy decoration-accent">Pablo Portas López</ins>. I am {(fixed => (new Date().getFullYear() - new Date(fixed).getFullYear() - (new Date() < new Date(new Date().getFullYear(), new Date(fixed).getMonth(), new Date(fixed).getDate()) ? 1 : 0)).toString())('2005-02-07')} years old and I’m studying Computer Engineering at the <ins class="decoration-fuchsia-800 decoration-wavy">Universidade da Coruña</ins>. Right now I’m on Erasmus in Sweden, at <ins class="decoration-amber-300 decoration-wavy">Linnaeus University</ins>, putting up with a bit of <ins class="decoration-dotted decoration-red-600">friaxe</ins> 🧊.

I’m a passionate man, I talk a lot, I like getting to know people, I enjoy travelling around this planet and, above all, I like trying to understand it. <span class="font-serif">Cinema</span>, <span class="font-mono">computing</span> and <i>filloas</i> are the things that make me happiest in the world 🌍.

My brief experience as a computer enthusiast is as follows:

<div class="px-8">
    <ol start="2013">
        <li>
            <p>At 8 years old I started tinkering with my first computer, a Toshiba laptop with <b class="font-bold">Windows<sup class="text-[#e38140]">XP</sup></b>.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="2015">
        <li>
            <p>At 10, my parents gave me my first laptop of my own, a red HP Pavilion, the same color as <i class="font-bold text-red-600">Lightning McQueen</i>. It had the freshly released <b class="font-bold text-[#3377cf]">Windows 10</b> (rest in peace).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>At 11, my mum bought me, at my request, <b class="font-bold text-[#67a245]">Minecraft</b> Windows 10 Edition. The game that marked my life and gave me my nickname <span class="font-mono">TeenBiscuits<s>4371</s></span> (Xbox Live generated a random username the first time you played a game).</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="2018">
        <li>
            <p>At 13 I got my first and only Victory Royale in <b class="font-bold text-[#6c269b]">Fortnite</b>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>At 14 I bought my first <b class="font-bold text-[#bc3658]">Raspberry Pi</b> (a 3B+) on which I installed Kodi to watch my entire anime collection acquired <ins class="decoration-dotted decoration-red-600">totally legally</ins>.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="2021">
        <li>
            <p>At 16 I set up my first <span class="font-bold font-mono">Linux</span> server (a Dell PowerEdge T40), which I still maintain to this day.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="2023">

            <p>At 18, after surviving the ABAU university entrance exams, I earned a place at the <ins class="decoration-fuchsia-800 decoration-wavy">Universidade da Coruña</ins>, where I study <span class="font-mono">Computer Engineering</span> and where I bought my <b class="font-bold">Slimbook Executive</b>, a Spanish laptop.</p>

    </ol>
    <ol start="2025">
        <li>
            <p>At 20, I got an Erasmus place at <ins class="decoration-amber-300 decoration-wavy">Linnaeus University</ins> and I switched to Unix with my first <b class="font-bold">MacBook</b>.</p>
